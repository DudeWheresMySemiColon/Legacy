#### What
Have you ever wanted to play a game a basketball on a whim, but have no one to play with? That's where GaME comes in. With GaME, you can look for other players in your area, message them, and find vacant courts to use (and not just for basketball). Sign up with Facebook and get started today!
#### Who
Faisal Al Qasimi (Product Owner)  
Jake Garelick (Scrum Master)  
Michael Ericson (Developer)  
Sonny Parsonage (Developer)
#### Why
We found that we wanted to play pickup games and meet new friends, but there was no suitable platform available to us. After inheriting a codebase, we added additional features to the product to make GaME a useful tool for athletes everywhere.
